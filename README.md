# A-Simple-testing-on-Neural-Network-for-Matlab
It is the homework of class Machine learning. Implemet what I have learned from this class. 
* Simple linear network 
* feed-forward and back-propagation
* Stochastic Gradient Descent for updating the weights.
* Bias neuron for regression task
* Only Sigmoid and ReLU were implemented as activate function
